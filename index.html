The entire map is a grid of rooms with openings to other rooms. To determine openings in a map, each room randomly opens some of its sides. Afterwords, the entire map is processed so that every room can be reached with the given openings. "Dead ends" in the map are assigned to have a function of having loot, either in the form of food or scrap.</p>

Animal behavior could be divided up into two states, present and out of view. When animals move out of view all of their physics are disabled and they move between objects with certain preset tags. When animals move within range of a player, they materialize in a nearby bush and begin wandering around.</p>

Animals are able to avoid collisions while moving by shapecasting in several directions until it finds a direction in which it does not hit an object. Animal sight detection is triggered when a object is a set angle away from the foward vector. Animals are able to hear by scanning objects with certain tags and checking their distance from said animal.</p>

Waves would shift the landscape of the island periodically, destroying plants and shifting fertility. Fertility is mostly determined by proximity to sea.</p>
